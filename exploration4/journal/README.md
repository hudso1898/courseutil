Link: https://www.hudso.dev:3000

Journal: [here](./Mrh4hdJournal.md) in markdown, [here](./Mrh4hdJournal.pdf) in pdf format. Screenshots are embedded in the journal.

You may insert your link and journal into this directory

Please include the screenshots in your journal for easy access. 

How did it go? Write about the topic you explored and what you experienced. This is your documentation. 

The documentation is a journal-style document that details the stuff you have explored. 

Your journal that reflects
- what you learned
- problems you faced
- and how you solved them 

The journal will be named “\<Pawpring\>Journal” with the corresponding file extension .md
 
For example: “Abc123Journal.md”

Your journal should be
- clear
- easy to read
- and be of some help

If the TAs are reading it, the journal should guide them through your findings and it should show off how much you explored.

Do not submit a word document or a text file, make sure it is a nicely formatted MarkDown file otherwise you will get points taken off

Make sure your document is easy to read and using correct markdown 

Use this for a reference: [https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)

If you go back and run through the material again or think about the TA reading this journal, it should help to guide them through your findings. Almost like your own personal tutorial with explanations. 

If you are unclear what you need to do for this, then please let me or TAs know.
