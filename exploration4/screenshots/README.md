# Screenshots 

**Find my screenshots in this directory, as well as embedded in [my journal](../journal/Mrh4hdJournal.md).**

You may insert your screenshots into this directory

Please embed your screenshots into the Journal for easy access

Remember, screenshots much include the system clock with the date and time 

Some screenshots should include your URL in the screenshots

If the date and time is not present, then the screenshot is not valid 

I recommend to take pictures of your finished product as well as some screenshots of code
